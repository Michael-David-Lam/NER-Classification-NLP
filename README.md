# NER Classification App 

Hosted on HuggingFace Spaces, this project showcases a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model built using DistilBERT and deployed through a Gradio web interface. The app takes user-input text, predicts entity labels, and highlights them in the UI. 
The model was determined through comparitive experimentation setups and trained on the [PLOD-CW-25](https://huggingface.co/datasets/surrey-nlp/PLOD-CW-25) dataset. Feel free to test it out with various phrases and words to see how it classifies each label.
